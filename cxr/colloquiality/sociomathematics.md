The following is the current colloquialisation of Complexor's sociomathematics. It is an evolving document, and as such only its most recent version should be considered by aspiring colloquialists.

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In sociological canon, the term sociomathematical is used *almost exclusively* to refer to norms regarding education (aka US education, the only one which matters). **In short, *that's fucking stupid***. Sociomathematics as a term is intensely valuable, and using it for such a narrow class of analysis is ***fucking stupid***, *especially when the education system being studied with it has all but collapsed*.

In order for the term to have any meaning, it *must* be defined in terms of the study and application of mathematics vis-a-vis its relation to socialisation and crystallisation of norms *in society as a whole*. We need to study how and why mathematical systems arise, how people relate to them, and what it leads them to believe about society as a whole. We *do not* need to saturate the space with these hyperspecific musings on why Jimmy is good at school math but Timmy is not.

Take angel numbers for example. If a person believes that numbers are being used to communicate with them in some way, what happens when the tweet they just sent out has a Snowflake ID with three 3s in a row starting from position 3? What if their preferred username is taken, and the system automatically suggests the same username with 77 added to it? Even if they don't believe in numerology, it's unlikely that they have *quantitatively derealised*[^1] notions of primality, or oddness, or even *luck*, in their interpretation of numbers. That has an impact on what they believe society is or does.

The assignments I will give in the name of sociomathematics - eg Colloquialist and such - is only one of *infinite* expressions of sociomathematical systems which constitutes a scientific "team". The purpose is not to redefine the entire concept in my specific way, but to share how interpretations of permutative and descriptive mathematical strings function when actively seeking *indicators*[^2]. It also offers a way to self-organise into social systems where roles are socially relevant but not overly specific given the youth of the system.

## A substantive definition <a name="substance"></a>

Sociomathematics is the study of numerical and mathematical systems in terms of their presence, usage, interpretation, and application by society at large. For example, a **sociomathematician** may study the relationship between academic and colloquial understandings of divisibility, such as the differences between divisibility tests by nine and seven, or the use of "threeven" as a moniker for divisibility by three (which itself is derived from the term for divisibility by two). This can actively feed into larger analyses such as the impact of non-divisibility of ten by three on the resultant "0.999... = 1" discourse.

Numbers occupy an important space in human languages. As outlined in Quantitative Derealisation, numerical connotation is constantly shifting and varies per person, which is why merely analysing things such as academic mathematical education is not sufficient for an understanding of human associations with quantity. Even still, the usage of numbers has itself become less about the quantity and more about the *string*. We don't expect to perform mathematical operations on the Snowflake ID of a Twitter URL after it's been generated (except when reverse-engineering a la [TweetedAt](https://oduwsdl.github.io/tweetedat/ )), we simply copy and paste it where we need it, and even treat it as a string in API implementations.

This is where a huge problem starts: We don't know how to read number words, especially ones that are that big. We divide numbers into *implicitly base one-thousand* digits[^3], then struggle to determine whether a number is in the quadrillions or quintillions. Our modes of analysis revolve around considering them quantities, and so we at least *try* to. But because numbers vary so wildly in connotation, it is safe to assume that *every individual attaches a distinct emotional representation to their interpretation of any decontextualised number*.

## Colloquiality <a name="colloquiality"></a>

One important term which needs to be expanded for purposes of this discussion is *colloquial*. For purposes of analysis, here is a set of extended words which provide greater flexibility to the notion of *colloquiality*:

* colloquialism: a turn of phrase with socially-upheld meaning
* colloquiality: presence, or even saturation, of colloquialisms to represent a particular facet of a subject, object, or related social fact
* colloquialise: to contribute to the social normality and/or crystallisation of a concept
* colloquialative: possessing properties which indicate social normality and/or crystallisation
* colloquialising: possessing properties which contribute to normalisation and/or crystallisation
* colloquialisation: the process through which a social artifact is colloquialised
* colloquialismic: of or relating to a colloquialism
* colloquialiser: something introduced to colloquialise something; colloquialisers *become colloquialismic* to the produced colloquialism
* acolloquial: not possessing any normative or crystallising features
* decolloquial: possessing counternormative, decrystallising features
* anticolloquial: possessing features which directly oppose the process of colloquialisation *of a particular system*; it is however colloquial in some system
* colloquialist: a sociomathematician who interacts and engages with society for purposes of research and experimentation, functioning as a participant-observer for a sociomathematical team

## Sociomathematicians <a name="sociomathematicians"></a>

While it is possible to observe subsets of society without interacting with them, it is impossible to perform any kind of metanalysis or experimentation without some form of participant-observership. It is imperative that such a PO and its supporting team are all sociomathematicians due to the ever-present nature of quantity within written languages, numerical and other. *In most cases, the ability to vary interpretation of quantitative language is vital to the ability of the team to meet the moment.*

### Terminal anticolloquiality <a name="terminal-anticolloquiality"></a>

The ongoing project of Complexor's sociomathematics is to establish a framework for constructing teams of social engineers who can address problems of *terminal anticolloquiality*.

"Anticolloquiality" is the state of existing outside of a particular social group. This can be caused due to language barriers, disability such as mental illness, presence within a certain niche, or as a consequence of actions taken within that group. For example, someone who spends a lot of time on TikTok might be experience anticolloquiality compared to a Boomer, while still being colloquial to other TikTokers. And someone who frequently says racist or transphobic things will often find themselves estranged from progressive spaces where their actions are known.

*Terminal* anticolloquiality, however, is more serious: "TA" occurs when an individual *fails to avoid anticolloquiality in any social group they attempt to participate in*. While it may occur at different rates, individuals experiencing TA inevitably become estranged or unwelcome within the social groups they exist within, *no matter how briefly they are within them*.

By nature, the terminally-anticolloquial suffer from being irretrievably removed from a society, to the extent that communication becomes incredibly difficult or impossible. This can lead to self-destructive behavior such as ennui, anomie, and even suicidality.

### Colloquialists <a name="colloquialists"></a>

In order to address TA, a team of social engineers must be constructed, led by the **colloquialist**. The colloquialist is the root scientist within a sociomathematical team. In short, the social role of the colloquialist is to be present within some social group and "grok vibes". In order to study and address TA, the colloquialist in place must perform the following:

* Interpret incoming indicators in terms of their colloquiality
* Determine the necessary indicator to meet the moment
* Execute

As a scientist, colloquialists must initiate self-experimentation in terms of seeking and delivering indicators within the context of the subject; this has the potential to alter the course of analysis by the ultary teams. Colloquialists are also responsible for outlining and describing the roles which ultary teammates serve.

In order to perform metanalysis, the colloquialist can multithread as an entire secondary team. However, this must be done in solitude to prevent indicators from influencing either metanalysis or ultary actions. Due to the nature of uncertainty, the actions of a colloquialist cannot be viewed as coordinated in any regard, *even in cases of extended instant reification*[^4].

### Secondary team <a name="team"></a>

Colloquialists are, in essence, the 0 of the experiment - there almost always is one, it is usually central to the process, and it tends to take the lead on ongoing operations.

In support of a colloquialist, there are various roles who ask certain types of questions:

* 1 - Analyst - What's going on?
* 2 - Catastrophist - What's going wrong?
* 3 - Interventionist - What needs to change?
* 4 - Contrarian - What are we wrong about?

### De/recolloquialisation team <a name="colloquialisation"></a>

Because of the risk of TA to the colloquialist, there are two roles which serve to counter the necessary anticolloquiality which arises from self-experimentation. Decolloquialisation is the process of reducing a colloquialist from their role back to normalcy. It is an *interrogative* and *therapeutic* process through which consensus about the nature of their nature is reestablished and reification occurs in spite of previous anticolloquiality.

* 5 - Interrogator - What else do we need to know?
* 6 - Therapist - How can newfound knowledge help?

Interrogators engage in *active decolloquialisation*, whereas Therapists engage in *active recolloquialisation*.

### Noncolloquiality team <a name="noncolloquiality"></a>

Entities which persist outside of, in spite of, or which are the determiners rather than the determinants of colloquiality in a given sphere, are termed *noncolloquial*. For example, the algorithm which governs what you see on TikTok is *colloquialising* while it is itself noncolloquial. Those who function in these roles attempt to sit outside of the colloquialative processes in which the rest of the team is usually engaged.

* 7 - Dreamer - Reimagine and recontextualise
* 8 - Interpreter - Evaluate from an alternative colloquial perspective

## The Historian <a name="historian"></a>

Designated as 9, Historians are the other imperative member of a sociomathematical team besides colloquialist. Like the colloquialist, they may and often do fill any role at any given time for purposes of achieving their primary goal: synthesis of the themes of the team's indications into a **reification**.

## Socioarithmetic <a name="socioarithmetic"></a>

Sociomathematical teams are altered by performing mathematical operations outlined by `clq.py`. Teams can be transformed via *inclusion*, *reduction*, *isolation*, and *rejection*. See [clq.md](./readme/clq.md) for a description of the technical process. **Socioarithmetic and sociomathematical strings also serve to describe individuals afflicted with dissociative disorders such as DID and OSDD, regardless of colloquiality.**

## Abbreviations <a name="abbreviations"></a>

* 6 - Therapist - th
* 7 - Dreamer - dr

* 9 - Historian - hist


## Indicators and Indications <a name="indicators"></a>

An indicator is any action or event which occurs in the context of society. Stopping to tie your shoes, turning around to look at a noise, a car driving by as you sit in the grass; all of these are indicators.

Indicators have a specific, seemingly-predetermined consequence for every individual which observes it, and no two perceptions of an indicator are the same. After all, each individual perceives them in the context of their material, social, and spiritual conditions, not to mention the interpreting brains occupy completely different physical space.

Indicators can be perceived in two ways, sometimes both simultaneously: They can be perceived by an individual which is capable of sensing its physical symptoms, such as seeing a flashing light or smelling food that is cooking; or they can be perceived by a mechanism which is attached to the indicating party when no other observer is present, such as through a CCTV camera or by a content-generating algorithm.

An indication is *an indicator given expressly to communicate intent to interact as a collective form*. Indications are a powerful colloquialative force whose expression sets the stage for *extant reification* of institutions and the crystallisation and recrystallisation of norms, *including sociomathematical ones*.

### Reifications <a name="reifications"></a>

A reification is the primary output of a sociomathematical team. It reinforces the institutions which it is present within when related indicators are executed by the colloquialist.
