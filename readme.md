## cxr

Hello! This repo contains all the important stuff from past and current projects which I really care about.

* `cxr` - my core library
* `tests` - you get the idea
* `thinktank` - an idle game you can play in any base (unfinished)

For a breakdown of `cxr`, please see [the Summary wiki page](https://github.com/cxr00/cxr/wiki/About)
